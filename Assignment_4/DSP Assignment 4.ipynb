    "In image processing, besides other methods, also the FFT can be utilized to conduct edge detection. To this end, a two-dimensional FFT (MATLAB command: $f f t 2$ ) is calculated from an image to transform it from spatial domain to frequency domain. Here, edges in an image produce high frequencies in the corresponding spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you should make the edges of an image visible. Start by making yourself familiar with the MatLAB script fft_edge_detection. Now filter the image in frequency domain, such that the edges become visible after a transformation back to spatial domain. Describe your approach and justify why it works. A solution could look the one depicted in Fig. 1.\n",

    "In the Dual Tone Multiple Frequency (DTMF) method, each of the 16 possible information symbols $q \\in\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, A, B, C, D, *, \\#\\}$ is represented by a superposition of two sinusoidal audio signals with different frequencies. The assignment of every symbols to the two frequencies contained in the corresponding audio signal is given in Tab. 1. The duration of a single symbol is $70 \\mathrm{~ms}$, and the audio signals of two symbols are separated by a pause of $30 \\mathrm{~ms}$. The file $\\mathrm{dtmf}$. wav contains a signal consisting of a sequence DTMF signals corresponding to a sequence of randomly chosen symbols, where the signal has been generated with a sampling frequency of $f_{s}=8 \\mathrm{kHz}$.\n",

    "(a) Write a MatLAB script, where you read in the signal and the sampling frequency from the file dtmf.wav. Hint: the MatLaB function audioread might be useful. Plot a $300 \\mathrm{~ms}$ long segment of the signal and put the resulting plot into your protocol (including a correct labeling of the axes, etc.). Given this signal segment in time domain, can you make any statement which symbols are contained in this segment?\n",
    "(b) Compute the spectrum for the whole signal length using the MATLAB command fft. Plot the magnitude of the spectrum. Label the axes correctly, with the frequency axis scale in $\\mathrm{Hz}$ (Hint: the frequency values given in Tab. 1 should be visible at the correct position on the frequency axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Now the so-called short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) should be implemented. To this end, the total signal is grouped into overlapping blocks of a specified length, and each block is transformed individually into frequency domain. Additionally, the individual blocks should be filtered using a Hamming window (MATLAB command hamming) for improving the spectral illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement the generation of the signal blocks given the total signal. Every block should have a length of 256 samples. Use an overlapping factor of 2, i.e., every block is overlapping with its preceding block by half the signal length. The last block should also have a length of 256 , i.e., if not enough samples from the total signal are left to obtain a block of length 256 , append the appropriate number of zeros.\n",

    "- Transform the windowed blocks to frequency domain using the FFT to obtain the Fourier transformed blocks (FTBs).\n",
    "- Plot a 2d diagram showing the FTBs. For this purpose, consider which frequency values have to be displayed on the frequency axis, and which time values have to be plotted on the time axis, i.e., which frequency range has been regarded with the FFTs and at which points in time have the FFTs of the individual blocks been computed? Generate two MATLAB vectors $f$ _stft and $t$ _stft, which contain the appropriate frequency and time values, respectively. Then, plot the diagram containing the magnitude of the STFT result using the MATLAB command surface ( $t$ stft, f_stft, abs(stft_mtx)), where stft_mtx is the matrix containing the individual FTBs. Display the amplitude information with the command colorbar. The STFT magnitude diagram in your protocol should look similar as in Fig. 2 (the symbol sequence might not be the same), where in Fig. 2 only the frequency range 0 $2000 \\mathrm{~Hz}$ is shown.\n",
