Plotting the Signals

Figure~\ref{fig:SignalPlot} shows two subplots, one for each frequency. In each subplot, it plots the original signal,
the time-delayed signal (in red dashed lines), and the phase-shifted signal (in green dot-dashed lines,
slightly transparent for better visibility).
The time-delayed and phase-shifted signals are expected to overlap completely,
demonstrating that a time delay is equivalent to a phase shift in the time domain.
