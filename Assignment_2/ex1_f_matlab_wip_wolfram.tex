\item[(f)]
All signal powers and energies computed in the previous steps are collected into a single table for a comprehensive overview.
This table facilitates comparison and further analysis.

\begin{verbatim}
% Define arrays for signal names, energies, and powers
SignalNames = {'x1'; 'x2'; 'x3'; 'x4'};
Energies = [energy_x1; energy_x2; energy_x3; energy_x4];
Powers = [NaN; NaN; power_x3; power_x4];  % NaN for non-periodic signals

% Create and display a table
T = table(SignalNames, Energies, Powers, 'VariableNames', {'Signal', 'Energy', 'Power'})
\end{verbatim}

This structure enables easy visualization and access to the energy and power data associated with each signal,
making it straightforward to draw comparisons and perform subsequent analyses.
