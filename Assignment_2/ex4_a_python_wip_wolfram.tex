\item[(a)]
A Python function to calculate the DTFT of a finite sequence is provided below.
The function employs NumPy's vectorized operations to avoid explicit for-loops.

\begin{verbatim}
import numpy as np

def dtft(x, n, w):
    """
    Compute the Discrete-time Fourier Transform (DTFT) of a finite sequence.

    :param x: finite duration sequence over n
    :param n: sample position vector
    :param w: frequency location vector
    :return: DTFT values computed at w frequencies
    """
    x = np.array(x)
    n = np.array(n)
    w = np.array(w)

    # Using matrix multiplication for vectorized computation
    X = np.exp(-1j * np.outer(n, w)) @ x
    return X
\end{verbatim}

This function calculates the DTFT using matrix multiplication, which is a vectorized operation
that can replace explicit looping constructs.
