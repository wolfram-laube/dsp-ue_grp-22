\item[(a)]
The MATLAB function to calculate the DTFT of a finite sequence is implemented without the use of for-loops.
The function uses vectorized operations to compute the DTFT over a vector of frequencies.
Here is the function code:

\begin{verbatim}
function X = dtft(x, n, w)
    % DTFT computes Discrete-time Fourier transform
    % @param x: finite duration sequence over n
    % @param n: sample position vector
    % @param w: frequency location vector
    % @return X: DTFT values computed at w frequencies

    % Ensure column vectors
    x = x(:);
    n = n(:);
    w = w(:)';

    % Using vectorized operations
    X = exp(-1j * n * w) * x;
end
\end{verbatim}

This function takes a finite sequence $x[n]$, a sample position vector $n$, and a frequency location vector $w$,
and returns the DTFT values computed at the specified frequencies.
