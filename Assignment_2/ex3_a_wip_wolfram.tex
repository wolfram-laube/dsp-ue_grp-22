\item[(a)]
The length $L_y$ of the output signal from the convolution of two signals, where the input signal $x[n]$ is defined for
$n = 0$ to $49$ (50 samples) and the impulse response $h[n]$ is defined for $n = 0$ to $2$ (3 samples), is given by:
$$
L_y = N + M - 1 = 50 + 3 - 1 = 52
$$
Here, $N = 50$ represents the number of samples in $x[n]$ and $M = 3$ represents the number of samples in $h[n]$.
The output signal $y[n]$ will thus consist of 52 samples.
