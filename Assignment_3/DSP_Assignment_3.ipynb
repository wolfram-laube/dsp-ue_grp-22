    "\n",
    "The discrete time signal $x[n]=\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sin \\left(2 \\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot n\\right)$ is converted to the analogue signal $x(t)$ with an DAC which uses a clock frequency of $8 \\mathrm{kHz}$ and which converts a numerical value of 1 to $1 \\mathrm{~V}$.\n",

    "a) Up to $20 \\mathrm{kHz}$, list all positive frequencies which occur (in general) in $x(t)$.\n",

    "2. What is the power (in $\\mathrm{dB}$ ) of the first out-of-band sinewave (the sine with the second lowest frequency).\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Qualitatively draw the spectrum of $x(t)$ up to $20 \\mathrm{kHz}$. Delta pulses should be drawn with an arrow, the height of the arrow should indicate the weight of the delta-pulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The power of a sinewave with amplitude $A$ is $P=\\frac{A^{2}}{2}$ (also see Parseval's theorem for periodic signals DSP_02/27).\n",
    "- The impulse response of a 0 -order reconstruction filter is a rectangular pulse, its frequency response is thus given in $D S P_{-} 02 / 43$.\n",
    "- When calculating the attenuation for the respective frequencies it should be noted that e.g. Matlab uses the normalized sinc function.\n",

    "## Exercise 4 Signal Processing Onramp - BONUS (15\\%)\n",
    "\n",
    "This task is optional (additional 15\\%) and should help you to learn the basics of practical signal processing techniques in MATLAB. You will find out how to use spectral analysis and filtering for preprocessing, analyzing and extracting information from signal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that you need to carry out the full 'Signal Processing Onramp course' [1]. For getting the bonus points you need to add the certificate to your protocol (you can download a pdf - see 'Share Certificate and Progress'). Also, you need to share your progress with my account (matthias.wagner@jku.at), what can be done in the same tab.\n",
