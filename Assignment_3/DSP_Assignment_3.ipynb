    "\n",
    "#### Analysis\n",
    "1. **Discrete-Time Signal Frequency**:\n",
    "   - The discrete-time signal given is $ x[n] = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sin \\left(2 \\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot n\\right) $.\n",
    "   - Here, $ \\frac{1}{8} $ represents the normalized frequency with respect to the sampling frequency $ f_s $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculation of the Signal's Fundamental Frequency**:\n",
    "   - Given $ f_s = 8000 $ Hz (8 kHz), the frequency of the sinusoidal component can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     f = f_s \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} = 8000 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} = 1000 \\text{ Hz}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - Therefore, the fundamental frequency of the sinusoid is 1000 Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Frequency Content in $ x(t) $**:\n",
    "   - Since $ x[n] $ is being sampled at 8 kHz to convert to $ x(t) $, and considering the frequency of $ x[n] $ is well within the Nyquist limit, the primary frequency in the analog signal $ x(t) $ is the same as the fundamental frequency of $ x[n] $.\n",
    "   - The DAC converts the discrete-time signal into an analog signal, maintaining the fundamental frequency but potentially introducing higher harmonics due to the conversion process, though these are not mentioned in the problem and are generally unwanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Other Possible Frequencies**:\n",
    "   - Theoretically, if non-linearities or higher order effects were present (not specified here), additional frequencies could arise.\n",
    "   - Due to the sampling and reconstruction process, aliasing should not occur if all system components operate ideally and the signal is bandlimited properly by an anti-aliasing filter before sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "For the given signal and DAC specifications:\n",
    "- The positive frequency that occurs in $ x(t) $ up to 20 kHz is primarily the fundamental frequency of 1000 Hz. Assuming no non-linear distortions or additional frequency components are introduced by the DAC or other system components, no other frequencies are expected up to 20 kHz."

    "#### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Zero-Order Hold Impact on Spectrum**:\n",
    "   - A zero-order hold effectively holds each sample value constant over the sample period until the next sample is taken. This introduces a sinc-shaped distortion in the frequency domain, characterized by the sinc function's frequency response.\n",
    "   - The sinc function causes attenuation and ripple in the frequency spectrum, modifying the original sinewave's amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Baseband Sinewave Analysis**:\n",
    "   - The baseband frequency, as calculated earlier, is 1000 Hz.\n",
    "   - The power of the sinewave $P$ is given by $P = A^2/2$, where $A$ is the amplitude of the sinewave. For $x[n]$, $A = \\sqrt{2}$, so $P = 1$.\n",

    "   - Thus, the power in decibels of the baseband sinewave is:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     P_{dB} = 10 \\log_{10}(1) = 0 \\text{ dB}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - This result assumes no gain or loss in the system, which is idealized given the zero-order hold effect, which actually introduces some attenuation due to the sinc function's nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **First Out-of-Band Sinewave Analysis**:\n",
    "   - The first out-of-band frequency component occurs due to the zero-order hold and would typically be at the first zero of the sinc function, which is at the sampling frequency minus the base frequency (8000 Hz - 1000 Hz = 7000 Hz).\n",
    "   - Due to the nature of the sinc function, the power at the first zero is theoretically zero, but just before this point, there is significant attenuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Power in Decibels (dB) for the First Out-of-Band Sinewave**:\n",
    "   - Estimating the power just before the zero crossing, considering sinc function's typical roll-off, might give a very low power level. A rough estimate using the sinc attenuation might suggest around -13 dB or lower at the first sidelobe peak near the zero crossing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "- The power of the baseband sinewave, considering an ideal DAC without accounting for practical attenuation due to ZOH, is 0 dB.\n",
    "- The power of the first out-of-band sinewave would be significantly lower, potentially around -13 dB or more, depending on the exact behavior of the sinc function's first sidelobe.\n"

    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "Qualitatively draw the spectrum of \\( x(t) \\) up to 20 kHz, considering the effect of zero-order hold (ZOH) reconstruction. Delta pulses should be drawn with an arrow, where the height of the arrow indicates the weight of the delta-pulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Zero-Order Hold (ZOH) Characteristics**:\n",
    "   - A zero-order hold DAC holds each discrete signal value constant over the sample interval, essentially creating a step function between samples. The impulse response of this operation is a rectangular pulse.\n",
    "   - The Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse is a sinc function, resulting in a sinc-shaped spectrum that modifies the frequency components of the original signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Spectral Components**:\n",
    "   - **Base Frequency**: The original discrete-time signal \\( x[n] \\) has a fundamental frequency of 1000 Hz, resulting in a corresponding delta pulse in the spectrum.\n",
    "   - **Power Calculation**: The power of a sinewave with amplitude \\( A \\) is given by \\( P = \\frac{A^2}{2} \\). For \\( x[n] \\), \\( A = \\sqrt{2} \\), so \\( P = 1 \\) watt, which will be represented by the height of the delta pulse at 1000 Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sinc Function Influence**:\n",
    "   - The frequency response of the ZOH is given by a sinc function, which affects the amplitude of the spectral components. This influence results in a primary lobe around the baseband frequency and side lobes that attenuate in amplitude as they move away from the center frequency.\n",
    "   - The first null of the sinc function appears at the sampling frequency \\( f_s = 8000 \\) Hz, which serves as a guideline for the drawing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps for Drawing the Spectrum:\n",
    "- **Delta Pulse at 1000 Hz**: Mark a delta pulse at 1000 Hz with a height representing the power level of 1 watt.\n",
    "- **Overlay Sinc Function**: Overlay a sinc function shape across the spectrum. The main lobe should center around 1000 Hz, and side lobes should decrease in amplitude as they extend outwards.\n",
    "- **Consider Sinc Attenuation**: Show how the sinc function modifies the spectrum, particularly how it attenuates frequencies around 8000 Hz and 16000 Hz just before reaching the nulls.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "The spectrum of \\( x(t) \\) will exhibit characteristics dominated by the sinc function due to the ZOH effect, with a notable delta pulse at the fundamental frequency of 1000 Hz. The qualitative drawing will reflect the sinc function's impact, emphasizing the primary and side lobes up to 20 kHz.\n"
