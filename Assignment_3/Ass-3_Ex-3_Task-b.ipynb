    "# Introduction\n",
    "In Exercise 3, Task (b), we evaluate the effects of zero-order hold (ZOH) reconstruction on the power levels of specific frequency components in an analog signal derived from a discrete-time signal via a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). We focus on calculating the power in dB for the baseband sinewave and the first out-of-band sinewave.\n"
