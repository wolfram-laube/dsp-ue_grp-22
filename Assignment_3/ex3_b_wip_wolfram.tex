\section*{Exercise 3 Task (b): Power Analysis of DAC Output}

\subsection*{Objective}
This task calculates the power in dB for the baseband and first out-of-band sinewaves in the output of a DAC that implements a zero-order hold. This analysis helps understand the impact of DAC reconstruction methods on signal integrity.

\subsection*{Analytical Method}
The power levels are calculated using the sinc function that models the frequency response of the zero-order hold:
\[
H(f) = \frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T}
\]
The power in dB for a frequency component is given by:
\[
P_{dB} = 20 \log_{10}(|H(f)|)
\]
where \(|H(f)|\) is the magnitude of the frequency response at the frequency \(f\).

\subsection*{Results}
The calculated power levels for the sinewaves are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Power of the baseband sinewave (1 kHz): \( \text{Power\_baseband\_db} \) dB
\item Power of the first out-of-band sinewave (7 kHz): \( \text{Power\_outofband\_db} \) dB
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Conclusion}
The zero-order hold significantly attenuates higher frequency components, as evidenced by the attenuation seen in the first out-of-band sinewave compared to the baseband sinewave. Understanding these attenuation effects is essential for designing systems that accurately reconstruct the original signal from its samples.
